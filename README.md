# Inter-IIT-Tech-CAD

The report contains two files other than the readme file:
the .sldprt file of the saw and the other file is a pdf report describing the steps involved in making the model along with the screenshots. 

A major portion of the model is complete and it will be completed in the next phase of the project.
This is a solo project not involving any other team member.
